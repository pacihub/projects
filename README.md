# Project Title: Divfolio

*** version 1.0 ***

### App for comparing dividend paying stocks.

# Project goal:
    To help newbie investors educate themselves about the world of dividends and see how
    different companies pay them to their shareholders.

# Technologies:
     - Python 3.7.9
     - SQLite3
     - Java Script

# Functionalities:
    The app lets you create your own profile when you register. From there you can use the search 
    bar to search for stocks. Once the stock financial data is populated on the screen, there is 
    a functionality for saving stocks in a watchlist that is therefore linked to your profile. 
    The watchlist can be edited as well, meaning you can add/remove as many stocks as you want. 
    The watchlist is dividend centered, which lets you compare dividend yields between all the 
    stocks in your watchlist at a glance. Your watchlist is assigned to your profile and next 
    time you log in you will have access to it.

    Note: you will be prompted for your free API key from Alphavantage,
